This project aims to examine the dataset of drug side effects and the characteristics of individuals using these drugs, generate insights from the data, and prepare it for modeling. 

Within the master branch, there are three viewable files: 
 1- Data_Preparation.ipynb, which performs operations on the data 
 2- Drug_Side_Effects_Data_Documentation.txt, which provides a detailed documentation of the entire process
 3- side_effect_data.xlsx, which contains the data itself.
